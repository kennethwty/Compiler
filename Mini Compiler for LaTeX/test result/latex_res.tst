single works correctly, and can be used
to change the formating with respect to
the ways lines are output. In this case,
we are going from double to single
spacing.

 We have seen that there are many

   different Latex commands, that can be

   used in many different ways. However,

sometimes, we wish to use a character to

     mean itself, and override its Latex

     interpretation. For example, to use

curly braces, we employ the backslash a
