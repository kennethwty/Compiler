 This checks if all of the nestings

work with single in various locations. A

    Basic file that checks to see if the

centering command works correctly. Note

        that the double backslash should

indicate what should be centered and how


      Single is for Single spacing
  Verbatim allows text produced as is
  Itemize uses ticks to indicate items
  Center allows a block to be centered







 Now, make sure that double spacing is


Single is for spacing Verbatim allows text as is


Itemize has ticks for items Center is for centering







 A block of a enumerate within a

    single environment should change the


        1. Single is for Single spacing
        2. Verbatim allows text that matches the what you see is what you get mode
        3. Itemize uses ticks to indicate items
        4. Center allows a block to be centered







 Now, make sure that double spacing is


        1. Single is for Single spacing


        2. Single is for Single spacing. A second level of enums!!!!


        3. Center allows a block to be centered






 A block of a itemize within a double




         -- Page v --



        - Single is for Single spacing


        - Verbatim allows text that matches the what you see is what you get mode


        - Itemize uses ticks to indicate items






 Now try a single nested block of two


        - Single is for Single spacing

        1. Single is for Single spacing
        2. Verbatim allows text that matches the what you see is what you get mode
        3. Itemize uses ticks to indicate items
        4. Center allows a block to be centered


        - Verbatim allows text that matches the what you see is what you get mode
        - Itemize uses ticks to indicate items
        - Center allows a block to be centered







 Checking that a simple switch to

   single is working. In this case, upon

      encountering the single block, the

Single is for Single spacing Verbatim
allows text that matches the Itemize
uses ticks to indicate items Center
allows a block to be centered



Notice that all of the whitepace should

be removed and at this point, we should

return to whatever the spacing had been

   originally set to.

 Checking that a




 Single   is   for   Single   spacing
     Verbatim   allows         text     that   matches   the
 Itemize     uses   ticks   to     indicate   items
 Center     allows   a     block   to   be   centered
