        1. Design and develop a contex free grammar CFG for a subset of Latex.


        2. Design, implement, and test the common CFG which I will provide to you at a later date using Lex Flex and Yacc Bison .


        3. Design, implement, and test a syntax directed translator based on part 2 that automatically generates formatted ASCII text from an input Latex source file.





        - Design a CFG for the project that allows Latex programs e.g., text to be formatted to be recognized. This will provide you with important language design experience.


        - Calculate FIRST and FOLLOW for the non terminals listed below
