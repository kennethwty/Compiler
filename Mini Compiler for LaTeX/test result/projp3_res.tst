        2. Documentation of your solution that includes 1 any assumptions that you make regarding the output format and style of your document e.g., margins, page number locations, handling underlining, etc. 2 a log file that keeps track of all of your major design steps, implementation strategies, problems encountered with lex yacc and their solutions, aspects of the project that were easy hard, changes that were made to the grammar, etc. The key word is MAJOR design steps.
